Alder Wright in 1874 by adding two acetyl groups to the molecule morphine, found in the opium poppy. It is the 3,6-diacetyl ester of morphine. Heroin itself is an active drug, but it is also converted into morphine in the body. \n\n When used in medicine, it is typically used to treat severe pain, such as that resulting from a heart attack or a severe injury. The name heroin is only used when being discussed in its illegal form. When it is used in a medical environment, it is referred to as diamorphine. The white crystalline form considered pure heroin is usually the hydrochloride salt, diacetylmorphine hydrochloride. \n\n Illicit heroin is sometimes available in freebase form, dulling the sheen and consistency to a matte-white powder. Because of its lower boiling point, the freebase form of heroin is also smokable. It is prevalent in heroin coming from Afghanistan, which as of 2004 produced roughly 87% of the world supply in illicit raw opium. However, production in Mexico has risen six times from 2007 to 2011, changing that percentage and placing Mexico as the second largest opium producer in the world. \n\n Effects: \n\n Shortly after using, a feeling of euphoria will come over users, in which they have a warm flushing of the skin, a dry mouth and the feeling of having heavy arms and legs. After the initial rush, users will go into an alternately wakeful and drowsy state sometimes called on the nod. \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Infection of the heart lining and valves, normally due to lack of sterile technique, Liver disease - approximately 70-80% of new hepatitis C infections in the U.S. each year are the result of injection drug use, and even sharing snorting straws has been linked to hepatitis transmission, Kidney disease, Pulmonary complications, which are often infection related, Skin infections and abscesses, especially among chronic injectors who suffer scarred or collapsed veins. \n\n Overdose: \n\n The most serious health effect of heroin use is the possibility of death due to accidental overdose. Because heroin is an illegal drug and can be handled and cut (mixed with other ingredients) by various suppliers before it reaches street-level users, those who use the drug never know how potent or pure the heroin they are using is until they use it. Heroin is often mixed with sugar, starch, quinine, and sometimes, strychnine or other poisons, adding other potential dangers. Because of the unknown strength and actual contents of the heroin they are taking, users are at a great risk of overdose and death. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n - possession of paraphernalia used to prepare, inject or consume heroin \n\n - Needles or syringes not used for other medical purposes \n\n - Burned silver spoons \n\n - Aluminum foil or gum wrappers with burn marks \n\n - Missing shoelaces (used as a tie off for injection sites)  \n\n  Physical Warnings: \n\n  Weight loss, Runny nose (not explained by other illness or medical condition), Needle track marks visible on arms, Infections or abscesses at injection site, For women, loss of menstrual cycle (amenorrhea), Cuts, bruises or scabs from skin picking \n\n Treatment: \n\n Detoxification programs aim to achieve safe and humane withdrawal from opiates by minimizing the severity of withdrawal symptoms and other medical complications. The primary objective of detoxification is to relieve withdrawal symptoms while patients adjust to a drug-free state. Not in itself a treatment for addiction, detoxification is a useful step only when it leads into long-term treatment that is either drug-free (residential or outpatient) or uses medications as part of the treatment. The best documented drug-free treatments are the therapeutic community residential programs lasting 3 to 6 months.\n\n ");
      var6.putString("1", "Street Names: \n\n Coke, snow, flake, blow, nose candy, snowball, tornado, wicky stick, Perico, and Yayo \n\n Cocaine (INN) (benzoylmethylecgonine, an ecgonine derivative) is a crystalline tropane alkaloid that is obtained from the leaves of the coca plant. The name comes from coca and the alkaloid suffix, forming cocaine. It is a stimulant, an appetite suppressant, and a nonspecific voltage gated sodium channel blocker, which in turn causes it to produce anaesthesia at low doses. \n\n Biologically, cocaine acts as a serotoninÐnorepinephrineÐdopamine reuptake inhibitor, also known as a triple reuptake inhibitor (TRI). It is addictive because of its effect on the mesolimbic reward pathway. It is markedly more dangerous than other CNS stimulants, including the amphetamine class, at high doses due to its effect on sodium channels, as blockade of Nav1.5 can cause sudden cardiac death. \n\n  Effects: \n\n Taken in small amounts, cocaine usually makes the user feel euphoric, energetic, talkative, and mentally alert, especially to the sensations of sight, sound, and touch. It can also temporarily decrease the need for food and sleep. Some users find that the drug helps them perform simple physical and intellectual tasks more quickly, although others experience the opposite effect. Also short term effects include: constricted blood vessels; dilated pupils; and increased body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Large amounts of cocaine may intensify the user\'s high but can also lead to bizarre, erratic, and violent behavior. Some cocaine users report feelings of restlessness, irritability, anxiety, panic, and paranoia.  \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n With repeated exposure to cocaine, the brain starts to adapt, and the reward pathway becomes less sensitive to natural reinforcers and to the drug itself. Tolerance may developÑthis means that higher doses and/or more frequent use of cocaine is needed to register the same level of pleasure experienced during initial use. At the same time, users can also become more sensitive (sensitization) to cocaine\'s anxiety-producing, convulsant, and other toxic effects. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Use of cocaine causes tachyarrhythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening. This can lead to death from respiratory failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, or heart-failure. Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because the stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production \n\n  Heat loss is inhibited by the intense vasoconstriction. Cocaine-induced hyperthermia may cause muscle cell destruction and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Emergency treatment often consists of administering a benzodiazepine sedation agent, such as diazepam (Valium) to decrease the elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Physical cooling (ice, cold blankets, etc...) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used to treat hyperthermia, while specific treatments are then developed for any further complications. There is no officially approved specific antidote for cocaine overdose, and although some drugs such as dexmedetomidine and rimcazole have been found to be useful for treating cocaine overdose in animal studies, no formal human trials have been carried out \n\n Physical Warning Signs: \n\n - loss of the sense of smell \n\n - nosebleeds \n\n - difficulty swallowing \n\n - hoarseness \n\n  Behavioral Signs: \n\n - irritability \n\n - restlessness \n\n - anxiety \n\n - paranoia \n\n Treatmeant: \n\n Many behavioral treatments for cocaine addiction have proven to be effective in both residential and outpatient settings. Indeed, behavioral therapies are often the only available and effective treatments for many drug problems, including stimulant addictions. However, the integration of behavioral and pharmacological treatments may ultimately prove to be the most effective approach. \n\n");
      var6.putString("2", " Street Names: \n\nBennies, black beauties, bumble bees, co-pilots, Crank, Cross tops \n\n Barbiturates are drugs that act as central nervous system depressants, and can therefore produce a wide spectrum of effects, from mild sedation to total anesthesia. They are also effective as anxiolytics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsants. Barbiturates also have analgesic effects; however, these effects are somewhat weak, preventing barbiturates from being used in surgery in the absence of other analgesics. \n\n They have addiction potential, both physical and psychological. Barbiturates have now largely been replaced by benzodiazepines in routine medical practice Ð for example, in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia Ð mainly because benzodiazepines are significantly less dangerous in overdose. \n\n Effects: \n\n Recreational doses produce similar effects to alcohol intoxication: - slurred speech \n\n - unusual excitement \n\n - dizziness, confusion \n\n - impaired judgment \n\n - decreased motor control \n\n - respiratory arrest which can lead to death \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Once addicted, a user of barbiturates will often seek out the drug to obtain the same kind of high as achieved before. However, doing this requires more and more of the drug. And this is where things get dangerous, because the higher the dose of the barbiturate you take, the more likely it is that you will overdose.  \n\n  Unfortunately, abuse of this substance could lead to respiratory arrest, one of the primary causes of death in barbiturate abusers. Overdose symptoms include confusion, slurred speech, drowsiness, and fatigue and may even result in coma or death. If the drug is stopped suddenly, there is a high risk for withdrawal symptoms, which are very uncomfortable and even painful. Symptoms of withdrawal or abstinence include tremors, difficulty sleeping, and agitation. These symptoms can become worse, resulting in life-threatening symptoms, including hallucinations, high temperature, and seizures. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Symptoms of an overdose typically include sluggishness, incoordination, difficulty in thinking, slowness of speech, faulty judgement, drowsiness, shallow breathing, staggering, and in severe cases coma and death. The lethal dosage of barbiturates varies greatly with tolerance and from one individual to another. The amount of 1 g in dose orally can be highly poisonous with dosages from 2g to 10 g being generally fatal depending on the person\'s tolerance level. \n\n  Even in inpatient settings, however, the development of tolerance is still a problem, as dangerous and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms can result when the drug is stopped after dependence has developed. Barbiturates in overdose with other CNS (central nervous system) depressants for example, alcohol, opiates or benzodiazepines is even more dangerous due to additive CNS and respiratory depressant effects. In the case of benzodiazepines not only do they have additive effects, barbiturates also increase the binding affinity of the benzodiazepine binding site thus leading to an exaggerated effect of benzodiazepines. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse(physical): \n\n - Difficulty thinking \n\n  - Poor judgment \n\n - Slow and shallow breathing \n\n - Slow talking \n\n - Lethargy \n\n - Extreme sleepiness or even coma \n\n - Inability to walk properly, staggering or stumbling \n\n Treatment: \n\n While pharmacological support is not a usual part of the detoxification process from barbiturates, behavioral therapies are a key component to the recovery journey.  Behavioral therapies focus on working through any underlying issues that may have influenced the progression of the addiction.  The following are common types of behavioral therapies used for barbiturates addiction: \n\n - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Ð This category of rehabilitation is designed to work on a patientÕs maladaptive ways of thinking as a way influencing their behavior with an approach that is more positive. This also assists the patient in developing coping skills that replace negative skills with positive ones. \n\n - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Ð This type of cognitive behavioral treatment uses mindfulness and acceptance approaches mixed in multiple ways with strategies of commitment and behavior-change. This should enhance the emotional and mental flexibility. \n\n - Supportive Programs Ð This type of therapy includes 12 step programs such as Marijuana Anonymous (MA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Family therapy, group therapy, support groups, etc. are some additional examples of supportive programs. \n\n");
      var6.putString("3", " Street Names:\n\n Methadose, dollies, amidone, fizzies \n\n Street methadone is methadone sold or given to someone it was not prescribed for. \n\n Methadone is a powerful medication that is part of a group of drugs called opioids. Codeine, morphine, Percocet, OxyContin and heroin are all opioids. \n\n Methadone is prescribed by a doctor to treat people who have been addicted to opioids. When taken as prescribed, methadone is safe. It does not get a person high, but it does stop opioid withdrawal for a full day. A person who does not have to worry about withdrawal can find time to do things like go to school or work. \n\n When methadone is sold or given to someone it is not prescribed for, it is very dangerous. \n\n Effects: \n\n - euphoria \n\n - shallow breathing; \n\n - hallucinations or confusion \n\n - chest pain, dizziness, fainting, fast or pounding heartbeat \n\n - trouble breathing, feeling light-headed, or fainting \n\n - dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Methadone prescribed in high doses for a long period of time has no toxic effects and only minimal side effects for adult patients maintained in treatment for up to 14 years and for adolescent patients treated for up to 5 years. \n\n Life-threatening interactions of methadone with other drugs have not been identified. Drugs found to affect the metabolism of methadone include phenytoin (Dilantin) and rifampin. Opioid antagonists such as pentazocine (Talwin) and buprenorphine \n\n Overdose: \n\n Methadone overdose occurs when someone accidentally or intentionally takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medication. \n\n Methadone overdose can also occur if a person takes methadone with certain painkillers, such as oxycontin, Vicodin, or morphine. Seek immediate medical help. Do NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by Poison Control or a health care professional. \n\n OD Symptoms: \n\n - Coma \n\n - Disorientation \n\n - Spasms of the stomach or intestines \n\n - Shallow breathing/slow breathing  \n\n Warning Sings of Abuse: \n\n One way methadone abuse can be detected is by looking for the side effects methadone can cause. Many of these symptoms are common to many opiates and so could be a sign of the abuse of any one of several drugs, such as heroin, OxyContin, hydrocodone, morphine or others as well as methadone. \n\n Opiates often cause drowsiness, weakness, nausea, vomiting and constipation. The opiate user often has trouble sleeping so goes onto an unusual sleep schedule. The user may also have a headache, dry mouth, itchiness and lack of appetite. They may sweat, flush and gain weight. Their moods may swing through unusual patterns. \n\n Treatment: \n\n Methadone addiction is a bigger problem than ever, as many former heroin users turned to methadone treatment to help prevent heroin withdrawal symptoms in detox. While methadone does help to manage these physical symptoms to make it easier to get off heroin, it has many disadvantages of its own. The most significant disadvantage of methadone rehabilitation programs is that they cause a methadone addiction. \n\n Methadone may not be chemically structured in the same way as heroin, morphine, vicodin and other opiates, but it is equally addictive, if no more so. Methadone produces the same euphoric high as those other drugs as well as the same horrendous withdrawal symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, insomnia, anxiety and constant cravings. Many actually report methadone withdrawal to be even harsher than heroin withdrawal. Additionally, the FDA issued public health advisory warning of potentially life-threatening side effects of using methadone. \n\n Treating methadone addiction requires the same medication-assisted approach as treating heroin addiction. Luckily, however, there is now a drug that can help prevent withdrawal symptoms and other characteristics of detoxing off methadone without causing a similar replacement addiction. That drug is buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is the active ingredient in Suboxone and Subutex. The FDA approved it in 2002 for treatment of opiod addiction including heroin, oxycodone, methadone and others. \n\n");
      var6.putString("4", "Short-term effects of alcohol can take on many forms. The drug alcohol, to be specific ethanol, is a central nervous system depressant with a range of side-effects. Cell membranes are highly permeable to alcohol, so once alcohol is in the bloodstream it can diffuse into nearly every biological tissue of the body. \n\n - Overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria \n\n - Increased self-confidence  \n\n - Increased sociability \n\n - Decreased Anxiety \n\n - Impaired fine muscle coordination \n\n  - Impaired judgment  \n\n  Long Term Effects:  \n\n  The adverse effects of long-term excessive use of alcohol are close to those seen with other sedative-hypnotics (apart from organ toxicity which is much more problematic with alcohol). Withdrawal effects and dependence are also almost identical \n\n Alcohol at moderate levels has some positive and negative effects on health. The negative effects include increased risk of liver diseases, oropharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer and pancreatitis. Conversely moderate intake of alcohol may have some beneficial effects on gastritis and cholelithiasis. \n\n Of the total number of deaths and diseases caused by alcohol, most happen to the majority of the population who are moderate drinkers, rather than the heavy drinker minority. \n\n Chronic excess alcohol intake, or alcohol dependence, can lead to a wide range of neuropsychiatric or neurological impairment, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and malignant neoplasms. The psychiatric disorders which are associated with alcoholism include major depression, dysthymia, mania, hypomania, panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, suicide, neurologic deficits (e.g. impairments of working memory, emotions, executive functions, visuospatial abilities and gait and balance) and brain damage. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Alcohol poisoning is a serious Ñ and sometimes deadly Ñ consequence of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time. Drinking too much too quickly can affect your breathing, heart rate, body temperature and gag reflex and potentially lead to coma and death. Alcohol poisoning can also occur when adults or children accidentally or intentionally drink household products that contain alcohol. \n\n A person with alcohol poisoning needs immediate medical attention. If you suspect someone has alcohol poisoning, call for emergency medical help right away. \n\n Symptoms: \n\n - Confusion \n\n - vomiting \n\n - Seizures \n\n - Slow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute)  \n\n - Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths) \n\n - Passing out (unconsciousness) and can\'t be awakened  \n\n - Low body temperature (hypothermia) \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n - Repeatedly neglecting your responsibilities at home, work, or school because of your drinking \n\n - Using alcohol in situations where itÕs physically dangerous \n\n - Experiencing repeated legal problems on account of your drinking \n\n - Continuing to drink even though your alcohol use is causing problems in your relationships \n\n - Drinking as a way to relax or de-stress \n\n  Physical Warnings: \n\n  - bruises all over body \n\n - significant weight loss \n\n  - sick look in the face (gaunt) \n\n Treatment: \n\n Treatment techniques and tools to address alcohol use disorders (AUDs)* have multiplied over the last 30 years, moving beyond models based on Alcoholics Anonymous and its offshoot, the Minnesota Model. Care providers now can prescribe medications to aid people as they work to reduce their drinking. If a traditional mutual-help group model of care does not appeal to a patient, he or she has other behavioral therapy options. And Web-based approaches provide access to therapy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \n\n Despite these developments, however, the majority of people with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in the United States go untreated. Primary care providers are accustomed to prescribing medications for a number of illnesses, but generally are unfamiliar with medicines to treat alcohol problems. Medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat alcohol dependence include disulfiram (Antabuse¨), oral naltrexone, extended-release naltrexone (Vivitrol¨), and acamprosate (Campral¨) \n\n Medications are one tool to stop or reduce drinking, but successful long-term recovery centers on changing a personÕs behaviors and expectations about alcohol. Many treatment approaches, including mutual-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), focus on behavioral principles such as reinforcement and behavior modeling (for instance, these groups provide sponsors who guide participants through the program) to help patients make those changes. Since the mid-1980s, therapies have become available that combine behavioral principles of reinforcement and punishment with various therapeutic techniques designed to encourage healthy behavior change. \n\n");

Ketamine is generally used as a rapid-acting anesthetic drug mainly by veterinarians and occasionally in human surgery. It is also known as a Òdissociative anestheticÓ because it can make a person feel a sense of detachment, as if their mind is separated from their body. \n\n Commercial ketamine comes in the form of a liquid while the street drug is usually sold as a powder. When it is abused, the powder is typically dissolved in a liquid, snorted, or smoked in a cigarette. Liquid ketamine is sometimes injected into a muscle. Injecting it in a vein can cause rapid loss of consciousness. \n\n Ketamine is odourless and tasteless and easily dissolves in liquids, allowing it to be slipped into drinks without detection. Its sedative effects have been used to prevent victims from resisting sexual assault. For this reason, it has been called a date rape drug. Effects: \n\n Short-term use of ketamine can produce many other effects: \n\n - temporary paralysis (inability to move) \n\n -sleepiness \n\n - confusion \n\n - loss of coordination \n\n - blurred vision \n\n - inability to speak \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n - Urinary and bladder problems. Recent studies and case reports have linked ketamine abuse to urinary tract and bladder problems, including difficult or painful urination, frequent/urgent urination, incontinence, and severe bladder inflammation. In some cases, the damage may be irreversible. It is unclear how dose and duration of use affect the severity of these symptoms. \n\n - Infectious diseases. A person who shares drug supplies (like needles and straws) can spread infectious diseases like HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. \n\n - Birth defects. The extent to which ketamine may harm a developing fetus is unknown.  \n\n Overdose:  n emergency room settings, ketamine overdose patients are treated supportively. Respiratory, cardiac, and neurological functions are closely monitored and managed. \n\n  Typically, the outward symptoms of ketamine overdose are the psychotropic effects, including dreams, illusions, and hallucinations similar to LSD and PCP users. Benzodiazepines given intravenously are used to reduce these symptoms -- not to sedate the patient but to make it safer to manage the overdose victim. \n\n Benzodiazepines are not given to sedate ketamine overdose patients, because typically ketamine was not the only drug the patient took and drug interaction is a concern. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n Rather than creating a physical addiction, Kit Kat is a drug that creates a psychological dependency on it. After taking ketamine for awhile, you will start to associate the drug with pleasurable experiences. Not having access to it when you want to can trigger emotional withdrawal symptoms, such as depression, irritability and insomnia. In some cases, the psychological addiction can lead to binge behavior, where the user keeps ingesting the drug to continue in the experience longer. \n\n Ketamine does not appear to produce physical withdrawal symptoms in chronic users. There are anecdotal reports of tension, twitchiness, poor attention span, and restlessness in abstinent long term users, but this may be due more to the sedative norketamine (a breakdown product of ketamine) lingering in the blood stream. \n\n Physical Signs: \n\n  - Raised pulse and blood pressure \n\n - Elevated body temperature \n\n - Hallucinations- often vivid. \n\n - Pain blocked \n\n - Violent or bizarre behavior \n\n - Confusion/disorientation \n\n Treatment: \n\n Ketamine addiction treatment may include the following therapies and techniques: Individual therapy, Group therapy, Family therapy, 12-Step education, Relapse-prevention instruction, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Biofeedback & Neurofeedback, Medication management, Anger management, Hypnotherapy, Recreation therapy \n\n");

In tests in pentobarbital trained rhesus monkeys benzodiazepines produced effects similar to barbiturates. In a 1991 study, triazolam had the highest self-administration rate in cocaine trained baboons, among the five benzodiazepines examined: alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, triazolam. \n\n Benzodiazepines have been abused both orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential; the more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ÔpopularityÕ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was ÔstrongÕ and that it gave a good ÔhighÕ. \n\n Effects: \n\n A person using benzos is likely to look drowsy and sleepy, lack coordination, and be hostile and irritable. He or she may have vivid and disturbing dreams. Of course, two of the main effects of abuse are development of a tolerance and addiction. \n\n A person may not manifest anxiety even if that reaction might be normal for a situation. As several benzodiazepines are used in hospital settings before surgery, the fact that they cause amnesia is considered a plus. So the person abusing benzodiazepines may have a poor memory and complete amnesia of some events. \n\n  Long Term Effects: \n\n The effects of long-term benzodiazepine use include drug dependence as well as the possibility of adverse effects on cognitive function, physical health, and mental health. There are significant risks associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines. \n\n There is evidence that reduction or withdrawal from benzodiazepines can lead to a reduction in anxiety symptoms, while other\'s anxiety or panic respond only to benzodiazepine treatment. There are a number of side-effects associated with addiction to benzodiazepines such as depression and flu-like symptoms, nonetheless occurring in only a small amount of people. Due to these increasing physical and mental symptoms from long-term use of benzodiazepines, slowly withdrawing from benzodiazepines is recommended for many long-term users, while others benefit from lifelong benzodiazepine treatment and develop neither tolerance nor side effects. \n\n Some of the symptoms that could possibly occur as a result of long-term use of benzodiazepines include emotional clouding,  nausea, headaches, dizziness, irritability, lethargy, sleep problems, memory impairment, personality changes, aggression, depression, social deterioration as well as employment difficulties, while others never have any side effects from long term benzodiazepine use. \n\n For quite some time, it was disputed that benzodiazepine use interfered with one\'s ability to learn. In 2005, a study was published that stated that not only did the use of benzodiazepines interfere with visuospatial ability, speed of processing thoughts and perceptions and the ability to absorb verbal lessons, but also after a person withdrew from benzodiazepine use, these abilities did not fully return. Those who used benzodiazepines over a longer period of time were more impaired. It is interesting to note that while prescribing instructions specifically state that benzodiazepines should not be given for a long term, the participants in this study had been taking this type of drug for an average of nine years. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Benzodiazepine overdose describes the ingestion of one of the drugs in the benzodiazepine class in quantities greater than are recommended or generally practiced. Death as a result of taking an excessive dose of benzodiazepines alone is uncommon (vs Combined drug intoxication) but does occasionally happen \n\n Deaths after hospital admission are considered to be low. However, combinations of high doses of benzodiazepines with alcohol, barbiturates, opioids or tricyclic antidepressants are particularly dangerous, and may lead to severe complications such as coma or death. The most common symptoms of overdose include central nervous system (CNS) depression and intoxication with impaired balance, ataxia, and slurred speech. Severe symptoms include coma and respiratory depression. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. There is an antidote, Flumazenil (Romazicon), but its use is controversial. \n\n Warning Sings of Abuse: \n\n Signs of chronic drug abuse can be very nonspecific and include changes in appearance and behavior that affect relationships and work performance. Warning signs in children include abrupt changes in mood or deterioration of school performance. Chronic abuse of benzodiazepines can lead to the following symptoms that mimic many of the indications for using them in the first place: \n\n - Anxiety \n\n - Insomnia \n\n - Anorexia \n\n -Headaches  \n\n - Weakness \n\n Treatment: \n\n Benzos produces a calming effect that is quite satisfying for those who take the drug. For this reason, benzos are highly addictive both physically and mentally. Your body becomes dependent on benzos if you take them repeatedly over a period of time. Your mind also becomes dependent on benzos because they are so effective for calming nerves and anxiety symptoms that you feel afraid to not take it. \n\n  You may believe you wonÕt be able to handle stressful situations without benzos, and this fear could potentially lead to a serious panic attack in a social situation. There are other ways to treat anxiety and panic disorder without becoming addicted to a dangerous drug that could potentially kill you, like benzos. \n\n ");

How amphetamines affect a person depends on many things including their size, weight and health, also whether the person is used to taking it. The effects of amphetamines, as with any drug, also depend on the amount taken. \n\n Depending on how amphetamines are taken, the effects may be felt immediately (through injecting or smoking) or within 30 minutes (if snorted or swallowed). \n\n Low Dose Effects: \n\n  - feelings of euphoria, excitement and a sense of wellbeing \n\n - increased confidence and motivation \n\n - a sense of power and superiority over others \n\n -  increased talkativeness \n\n -  nervousness, anxiety, agitation and panic \n\n  - increased libido \n\n  - paranoia  \n\n - irritability, hostility and aggression \n\n - feeling more awake and alert, reduced need for sleep and difficulty sleeping \n\n - \n\n - increased heart rate and blood pressure \n\n  \n\n Higher doses: \n\n A high dose of amphetamines can cause a person to overdose. This means that a person has taken more amphetamines than their body can cope with. Not knowing the strength or purity of amphetamines increases the risk of overdose. Injecting runs a greater risk of overdose due to large amounts of the drug entering the blood stream and quickly travelling to the brain. \n\n The effects of a high dose of amphetamines can intensify some of the effects listed. People may also experience: \n\n - blurred vision \n\n  - tremors \n\n  - irregular breathing \n\n  - violent or aggressive behaviour \n\n  - stroke \n\n  - coma. \n\n   -  hallucinations \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Amphetamine use in adolescence can cause neurobiological imbalances and increase risk-taking behaviour, and these effects can persist into adulthood, even when subjects are drug free. These are the conclusions of a new study using animal models conducted by McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) researcher Dr. Gabriella Gobbi and her colleagues. The study, published in The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, is one of the first to shed light on how long-term amphetamine use in adolescence affects brain chemistry and behaviour. \n\n Amphetamine is a psychostimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus, in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. This drug, commonly known as speed, is also used recreationally and as a performance enhancer. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODOC) report (2011), more than 10 per cent of adolescents in the U.S. have used amphetamines. In Europe, between two and seven per cent of adolescents have tried amphetamines, and in Canada the number is estimated at just over five per cent. \n\n Overdose: \n\n An amphetamine overdose is rarely fatal with appropriate care, but can lead to a number of different symptoms that vary widely among individuals. A moderate overdose may induce symptoms including: agitation, arrhythmia, confusion, dysuria, hypertension or hypotension, hyperreflexia, myalgia, tachypnea, tremor, urinary hesitancy, and urinary retention. An extremely large overdose may produce symptoms such as adrenergic storm, anuria, cardiogenic shock, circulatory collapse, hyperthermia, amphetamine psychosis, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, serotonin syndrome, and stereotypy. Fatal amphetamine poisoning usually also involves convulsions and coma. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n - Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly Ñ this can be daily or even several times a day \n\n - Doing things to obtain the drug that you normally wouldn\'t do, such as stealing \n\n - lack of energy when not high \n\n - depressed without amphetamines \n\n  - weight loss \n\n Treatment: \n\n Users of amphetamines generally receive treatment in outpatient drug services that, in countries with histories of significant levels of the use of amphetamines, may specialise in treating this type of drug problem. Treatment for the most problematic users of amphetamines may be provided in inpatient drug services or in psychiatric clinics or hospitals. Specific services targeting amphetamine users are available in few countries in Europe and not much information is available. Dexamphetamine has long been available for the treatment of highly problematic users of amphetamines in England and Wales; however, information on this practice in the United Kingdom is limited. ");

Further uses of tobacco are in plant bioengineering and as ornamentals, and chemical components of tobacco are used in some pesticides and medications. \n\n Nicotine is an active chemical substance present in tobacco that contributes to the negative reputation of tobacco. This chemical, when abused (through smoking or chewing) has harmful effects on the human body and it is also found to be as addictive as illegal drugs. The below are a few harmful and addictive effects of nicotine on humans, later followed by long and short-term effects. \n\n  Tobacco harms every organ of the body. It affects lungs, heart, kidneys, digestive system, liver, eyes and many other vital organs in the body. Further, people who smoke tobacco get their sense of smell and taste weakened. \n\n Effects: \n\n In the short-term, nicotine is found to cause high blood pressure, increased pulse rate and cough. The abuse of nicotine also has immediate effects on oral cavity which causes bad breath and staining of teeth. In severe cases, it may also lead to oral cancer. Some short term effects: \n\n - Bad breath \n\n - Stained teeth \n\n -  Smoker\'s cough \n\n  - Increased heart rate and blood pressure \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Long-term effects of nicotine include addiction, increased risk of heart diseases, and decline in insulin levels, cancer and premature aging. Long-term effects of nicotine are very harmful and may also lead to fatalities in many cases. \n\n To list a few:  \n\n  - Heart Disease \n\n - Cancer \n\n - Lung Disease \n\n - Reproductive Damage \n\n - Birth Defects \n\n Overdose: \n\n Overdosing on tobacco products is called nicotine poisoning. Nicotine poisoning describes the symptoms of the toxic effects of consuming nicotine, which can potentially be deadly. Historically, most cases of nicotine poisoning have been the result of use of nicotine as an insecticide. More recent cases of poisoning typically appear to be due to accidental ingestion of tobacco or tobacco products or ingestion of nicotine containing plants. \n\n The probable lethal dose of nicotine has been reported as between 40 and 60 milligrams (the total amount in about 2 cigarettes if all of the nicotine was absorbed) in adults and about 1 mg/kg in children (less than 1 cigarette). \n\n Treatment: \n\n  NRT(Nicotine Replacement Treatments): \n\n Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), such as nicotine gum and the transdermal nicotine patch, were the first pharmacological treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in smoking cessation therapy. NRTs are used (in conjunction with behavioral support) to relieve withdrawal symptomsÑthey produce less severe physiological alterations than tobacco-based systems and generally provide users with lower overall nicotine levels than they receive with tobacco. \n\n  An added benefit is that these forms of nicotine have little abuse potential since they do not produce the pleasurable effects of tobacco products, nor do they contain the carcinogens and gases associated with tobacco smoke. Behavioral treatments, even beyond what is recommended on packaging labels, have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of NRTs and improve long-term outcomes.  \n\n Medications: \n\n  Although the primary focus of pharmacological treatments for tobacco addiction has been nicotine replacement, other treatments are also available. For example, the antidepressant bupropion was approved by the FDA in 1997 to help people quit smoking and is marketed as Zyban. Varenicline tartrate (Chantix) is a medication that recently received FDA approval for smoking cessation. This medication, which acts at the sites in the brain affected by nicotine, may help people quit by easing withdrawal symptoms and blocking the effects of nicotine if people resume smoking. \n\n Behavioral Treatments: \n\n Behavioral interventions play an integral role in smoking cessation treatment, either in conjunction with medication or alone. A variety of methods can assist smokers with quitting, ranging from self-help materials to individual cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions teach individuals to recognize high-risk smoking situations, develop alternative coping strategies, manage stress, improve problemsolving skills, and increase social support. Research has also shown that the more therapy is tailored to a personÕs situation, the greater the chances are for success.  \n\n");

Ecstacy refers to a drug usually in pill form in which you may see on the street. Usually, ecstacy is filled with small amounts of MDMA and loaded with other possible toxic or harmful ingredients. If someone is going to try ecstacy, MDMA is almost always a better choice, it is just cleaner. \n\n  MDMA can induce euphoria, a sense of intimacy with others, diminished anxiety, and mild psychedelia. Many studies, particularly in the fields of psychology and cognitive therapy, have suggested MDMA has therapeutic benefits and facilitates therapy sessions in certain individuals, a practice for which it had been formally used in the past. Clinical trials are now testing the therapeutic potential of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety associated with terminal cancer \n\n Effects: \n\n  - Gives you energy \n\n - Distorts time and perception \n\n - Euphoria \n\n - Increases enjoyment from touching \n\n - Inability to regulate temperature \n\n - Sharp increase in body temperature, hyperthermia, heatstroke \n\n - Liver, kidney, and cardiovascular system failure \n\n - Perceptual changes, anxiety, jaw-clenching, dry mouth, and appetite changes \n\n - Dehydration \n\n - Muscle tension \n\n - Empathy \n\n - Feeling of connection to others \n\n - Day-after depression \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n It is not understood how the chemical effects of MDMA induce its psychoactive effects. Hyperchalemia. Most explanations focus on serotonin release. MDMA causes serotonin vesicles in the neurons to release quantities of serotonin into the synapses. Studies using pretreatment with an SSRI to block the ability of MDMA to release serotonin in volunteers suggest serotonin release is necessary for most psychoactive effects of MDMA in humans.  \n\n - Dramatic increase in heart rate, leading to serious complications for people with cardiovascular disease. \n\n - Disturbing emotional reactions, confusion, depression, sleep problems, drug craving, severe anxiety, and heart palpitations. Symptoms last a long time after taking the drug \n\n - Depletes the amount of serotonin in the brain and blocks uptake of serotonin. \n\n - Toxic to the brain. \n\n - Brain damage is directly related to amount and frequency of usage. \n\n - Memory loss \n\n Overdose: \n\n Due to the difference between the recreational dose and the lethality dose, it is extremely rare for a death to be accredited just to the consumption of MDMA. While a typical recreational dose is roughly 100Ð150 mg (often being measured by eye and dealt with as fractions of a gram), this dose is often then repeated but remains well below the lethal dose. Consumption of the drug can be self-reinforcing while under the influence, and overdoses can occur. \n\n The standard treatment for MDMA overdose given in hospitals includes a range of drugs such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine but these are often of limited efficacy. MDMA overdose mainly results in hyperthermia and hyponatremia, which leads onto convulsions from the hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis (toxic muscle breakdown) from the hyperthermia. These complications can be treated; benzodiazepines such as diazepam or lorazepam are used to control convulsions and dantrolene blocks rhabdomyolysis. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n If you want to know if your loved one is using ecstasy, watch for small colored pills in the person\'s pockets or bags. There may be candy necklaces on stretchy strings. Some of the MDMA may be ecstasy pills. These pills often have imprints of characters or product logos, like the Mercedes auto logo. Occasionally ecstasy is used in liquid form. \n\n Other signs of ecstasy use would include irregular sleeping schedule and a lack of awareness of pain. For example, if a person got hurt and did not realize it, you might suspect a sign of ecstasy use.  \n\n It might be hard to determine if the party-goer is more sexually active than usual, but ecstasy use is commonly connected with multiple sexual partners. A symptom of ecstasy use includes a person feeling like they are in love with the person they are with, even if they just met. \n\n Physical Warning Signs: \n\n - Dilated pupils \n\n - sweating \n\n - talking fast \n\n - jaw clenching \n\n - over energized for no apparent reason \n\n Treatment: \n\n Ecstasy abuse treatment is available for those who suffer from addiction. There are no drug treatments for addiction to ecstasy, so cognitive-behavioral therapy is commonly used to help manage the psychological effects of the drug after detoxification.

Pharmacologically, the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); it is one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 84 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and cannabigerol (CBG). \n\n Marijuana has been used as an agent for achieving euphoria since ancient times; it was described in a Chinese medical reference traditionally considered to date from 2737 B.C. Its use spread from China to India and then to N Africa and reached Europe at least as early as A.D. 500. \n\n Effects: \n\n  - Relaxant \n\n - Altered sensual perception (taste, smell, sound) \n\n - Alters memory and thinking, users lose track of their thoughts \n\n - Impairs or inscreases coordination \n\n - Excitement  \n\n - Large doeses may cause hallucinations \n\n - Reddened eyes \n\n - Munchies (intense hunger) \n\n - Drowsiness \n\n - Anxiety (some users) \n\n - Paranoia \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Using marijuana heavily for a long period of time can have serious side effects. Marijuana smoke contains chemicals that damage the lungs and can lead to chronic coughing, lung infections, and in some cases, cancer. People who smoke both marijuana and tobacco may develop lung, neck and head cancers at a younger age than those who smoke only tobacco. eavy marijuana use at a young age may affect brain development, especially in the areas of the brain that control the ability to focus attention. Many long-term users have problems with: \n\n - concentration \n\n - abstract thinking \n\n - short-term memory  \n\n Most of these problems disappear after a few weeks without marijuana, but some may last longer. Heavy marijuana users may also experience mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. In some cases, it may trigger schizophrenia in people who have a family history of this disease. \n\n Overdose: \n\n  To overdose on Marijuana and have it be fatal, the user would have to ingest 40,000 times the amount of THC in one joint. I dare anyone to try that, as it is almost impossible. However, the typical marijuana user can use to much marijuana at one time they can experience negative effects such as vomiting, paranoia and anxiety. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n Marijuana smoke has a pungent and distinctive, usually sweet-and-sour odor. Behavioral changes that may be symptoms of marijuana addiction include: \n\n - distorted perception \n\n  - impaired coordination \n\n  - lack of motivation \n\n  - weird eating habits \n\n  - weird sleeping habit \n\n - smell of weed on clothes \n\n Physical Warning Signs: \n\n red, blurry, bloodshot eyes\n\n - constant, mucus-filled cough \n\n - rapid heartbeat  \n\n - hunger, referred to as munchies \n\n - dry mouth \n\n - anxiety, paranoia, or fear \n\n - slow reaction time \n\n Treatment: \n\n While many people with a marijuana-use disorder successfully stop using it with outpatient psychotherapy that provides motivation and teaches coping skills, the relapse rate is quite high, about 67% after the first year. However, when treatment is provided frequently, that statistic improves. Individuals who begin smoking marijuana before 17 years of age seem to be more than three times more likely to attempt suicide than those who either never use the substance or do so after the age of 17.  \n\n That risk goes the other way as well, in that people who develop depression or have thoughts of suicide before the age of 17 seem to be at a much higher risk of developing an addiction to marijuana. People who are vulnerable to developing psychosis (for example, having hallucinations like seeing things or hearing voices that aren\'t there; or delusions, like unfounded beliefs that others are trying to harm him or her) may be more likely to do so if marijuana is used, even on a medicinal basis. Marijuana abuse or addiction is also associated with a much higher risk of developing a dependence on other drugs. \n\n ");
      var6.putString("11", "Nicknames: \n\n Red Vein, Bali, Powder, Kit-krat \n\n Mitragyna speciosa (kratom, kratum, krathom) is a tropical deciduous and evergreen tree in the coffee family (Rubiaceae) native to Southeast Asia in the Indochina and Malesia floristic regions. Its leaves are used for medicinal properties. It is psychoactive, and leaves are chewed to uplift mood and to treat health problems. M. speciosa is indigenous to Thailand and, despite growing naturally in the country, has been outlawed for 70 years and was originally banned because it was reducing the Thai government\'s tax revenue from opium distribution. \n\n Kratom behaves as a mu-opioid receptor agonist like morphine and is used in the management of chronic pain, as well as recreationally. However, its effects differ significantly from traditional opiates such as morphine. Kratom use is not detected by typical drug screening tests, but its metabolites can be detected by more specialized testing. The pharmacological effects of kratom on humans, including its efficacy and safety, are not well-studied.\n\n Kratom has been traditionally chewed, in raw leaf form, by people in Thailand and especially in the southern peninsula. Kratom is also used in neighboring countries in Southeast Asia where it grows naturally. As traditionally used, kratom is not seen as a drug and there is no stigma associated with kratom use or discrimination against kratom eaters. In southern Thailand, kratom has been a part of traditional culture for thousands of years and is common in traditional cultural performances and in agriculture. \n\n  In southern Thailand, kratom chewers generally start at around the age of 25 and many continue to chew the leaves for the rest of their lives. The average number of leaves consumed is between 10 and 60 leaves consumed daily, but even more than this is common. In southern Thailand, upwards of 70% of the male population uses kratom on a daily basis in some areas. Traditional use of kratom is considered equivalent to drinking coffee  \n\n Effects: \n\n Kratom is a rather unique drug in that a low to moderate dose will usually (but not always) be stimulating, while a high dose is almost always quite sedating. This is apparently because the active alkaloids have both stimulant and sedative effects. Which predominates probably depends both on blood level and individual differences between users. \n\n The stimulant level: At the stimulant level the mind is more alert, physical energy and sometimes sexual energy is increased, ability to do hard monotonous physical work may be improved, one is more talkative, friendly, and sociable. Some people find this level edgy rather than pleasant. \n\n The sedative-euphoric-analgesic level: At this dosage you will be less sensitive to physical or emotional pain, feel and look calm, have a general feeling of comfortable pleasure, and may enter a pleasant dreamy reverie. You may experience some itching or sweating. Your pupils may be constricted (small). It is possible you may feel nauseated, but if you lie down and relax the nausea should quickly cease.  \n\n You may find your appreciation of music is increased. It will be very pleasant to lie down on your back in a semi-darkened room, with eyes closed, and just listen to your favorite music. If you do this you may be fortunate enough to enter the delightful mixed-state of Ôwaking-dreamingÕ where you have one foot in dreamland and the other foot in the real world. This state was much prized by the 19th century Romantic writers, who, lacking knowledge of kratom, resorted to the much more habit-forming narcotic, opium, to achieve it. The effects of kratom usually last about six hours. The higher the dose, the stronger the effects, and the longer they last. Many people report a positive ÔafterglowÕ the next day. \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n The long term effects of kratom are not well known in western culture. There was a study done on chewers of fresh kratom leave in Thailand who had been chewing the leaf for 30 plus years every day. Some of the users were noted to have yellowed skin, be thin and frail and very dependent on the primary chemical in kratom. However, most scientists believe long term use of kratom is safe. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Overdose with kratom is like marijuana it is almost impossible. Users cannot overdose on the primary chemical in kratom and no one has every died from a kratom overdose and its been used for thousands of years. Like THC however, if the user consumes to much kratom at one given time they may experience negative side effects such as vomiting, nausea, anxiety, drowsiness or physical discomfort. \n\n Treatment: \n\n If one makes the comparison to the legal consumption of alcohol leading to alcoholism, it is easy to understand the significance of Kratom addiction as it applies to teens. \n\n The first step in the recovery process will be the detoxification of the teen. This process is similar to other withdrawal periods, even though the drug is new on the American market. Therefore, each withdrawal experience is somewhat unique until further studies can be conducted. \n\n Once the poisons have been removed from their system, the teen will enter the treatment phase of their recovery. Treatment options include outpatient therapy, medical inpatient rehabilitation and aftercare services.  \n\n");

They starve the body of oxygen and force the heart to beat irregularly and more rapidly. People who use inhalants can lose their sense of smell, suffer nausea and nosebleeds and may develop liver, lung and kidney problems. Continued use can lead to reduced muscle mass, tone and strength. Inhalants can make people unable to walk, talk and think normally. Much of the damage is caused to the brain tissue when the toxic fumes are sniffed straight into the sinus. \n\n Effects: \n\n In addition to the above, inhalants can kill a person by heart attack or suffocation as the inhaled fumes take the place of oxygen in the lungs and central nervous system.

Its effects have been described anecdotally as comparable with alcohol and ecstasy use, such as euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced sensuality and empathogenic states. At higher doses, GHB may induce nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, agitation, visual disturbances, depressed breathing, amnesia, unconsciousness, and death. The effects of GHB can last from 1.5 to 3 hours, or even longer if large doses have been consumed. \n\n Consuming GHB with alcohol is dangerous as it can lead to vomiting in combination with unrouseable sleep, a potentially lethal combination. In general, the doses used recreationally are between 500 mg and 3,000 mg. When used as a recreational drug, GHB may be found as the sodium or potassium salt, which is a white crystalline powder, or as GHB salt dissolved in water to form a clear solution. \n\n Effects: \n\n Low Dose: A low dose of GHB (usually from .5 to 1.5 grams) often causes effects similar to those of 1-3 drinks of alcohol. Users can feel a mild relaxation, increased sociability, slightly decreased motor skills, sometimes mild dizziness, and other effects similar to mild alcohol intoxication. Even at low doses it is improper and dangerous for GHB users to drive or operate heavy machinery. \n\n Medium Dose:  A medium dose of GHB (usually from 1 to 2.5 grams) increases the relaxing effects and the physical disequilibrium experienced. Some people report an increased appreciation for music, dancing, or talking. Many people report positive mood changes. Some slurring of speech, silliness, and slight incoherency are also common. Others report increased feelings of nausea and grogginess. Some users of GHB report pro-sexual effects: an increase in tactile sensitivity, relaxation, increased male erectile capacity, and heightened experience of orgasm. Some women report that GHB makes orgasms harder to achieve. \n\n High Dose: A heavy dose of GHB (from 2.5 + grams) can increase feelings of disequilibrium in many people to point of feeling quite ill. Many people accidentally move from Medium Dose to Over Dose, only passing through Heavy Dose for a few minutes. One reason that GHB has gained notoriety as a Club Drug is that some people experience extremely positive feelings on Heavy Doses of GHB. Reports of euphoria, feeling music deeply, joyous dancing, and other very positive effects are common among aficionados. People who report these effects also describe how difficult finding one\'s personal dose range can be to achieve these effects. An extra quarter (.25) gram can be the difference between euphoria and vomiting. \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n As the dose increases, the sedative effects may result in sleep and eventual coma or death. Other effects include difficulty thinking, hallucinations, slurred speech, headaches and amnesia. GHB has reportedly been used in cases of date rape. Because GHB is odorless and tasteless, it can be slipped into someoneÕs drink without detection. \n\n  Overdose: \n\n The Overdose range for GHB can be as little as 2 grams, based on body weight and individual sensitivity. One major problem with GHB as an underground recreational substance is that it has a sharp dose-response curve, which can be difficult to manage with the various non-standard preparations available to the uninformed buyer. Another major problem is that uninformed users often mix GHB with alcohol, which drastically increases the chance of vomiting and unconsciousness.  \n\n An overdose can consist of mild to extreme nausea and dizziness, and vomiting. It can also be characterized by a strong drowsy feeling followed by an temporarily unrouseable sleep (sometimes characterized as a type of coma) for 1-4 hours. Some Overdoses of GHB mix vomiting with unconsciousness which is an extremely dangerous combination for obvious reasons. When using GHB (or any substance), it is important to remember to let someone who is with you know what you\'re doing, so if you experience Overdose effects, they can react appropriately and let any health professionals who become involved know what substance was involved. \n\n Treatment and Addiction: \n\n GHB abuse, over time, leads to both physical and psychological addictions that combine to form a vice grip over the life of the user Ñ causing difficult withdrawal symptoms for those who attempt to quit. \n\n When it comes to overcoming the withdrawal symptoms associated with GHB detox, the assistance of medically-trained professionals makes all the difference.

It is widely accepted that set and setting are the most important determinant of experiences with psychedelics, while the drug only plays the role of a catalyst or trigger. \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Flashbacks, or recurrences, of an LSD ÒtripÓ can be experienced long after the drug is taken and its effect has apparently worn off. The ÒtripÓ itself usually begins to clear up after about 12 hours, but some users manifest long-lasting psychoses. \n\n Overdose: \n\n LSD does not act on your brain the same way that drugs like cocaine or meth do, and it is not generally physically addictive. It is possible to build a tolerance to LSD, requiring larger doses over time to achieve the same high or trip, and this can lead to LSD overdose symptoms. \n\n While LSD overdose symptoms are rare and not usually life-threatening on their own, the effects of LSD can be dangerous to the user and possibly to those around him or her. Users of this drug can experience flashbacks to previous highs. These flashbacks can last up to a year after you stop using LSD, and severe depression or schizophrenia can develop as a result of long-term LSD use. \n\n LSD is a dangerous drug because it is possible that you might harm yourself in response to the irrational thoughts that can result from using the drug. For example, sometimes people think they can fly after taking LSD and then act on that thought. \n\n Treatment: \n\n There is no treatment for LSD addiction. LSD is not physically or mentally addicting. \n\n ");
      var6.putString("15", "Street Names: \n\n Diviner\'s Sage, Seers Sage, Ska Mar’a Pastora \n\n Salvia is a psychoactive plant which can induce dissociative effects and is a potent producer of visions and other hallucinatory experiences. Its native habitat is in cloud forest in the isolated Sierra Mazateca of Oaxaca, Mexico, where it grows in shady and moist locations. The plant grows to over a meter high, has hollow square stems, large leaves, and occasional white flowers with violet calyxes. Botanists have not determined whether Salvia divinorum is a cultigen or a hybrid; native plants reproduce vegetatively, rarely producing viable seed. \n\n Salvia divinorum remains legal in most countries and, within the United States, is legal in the majority of states. However, some have called for its prohibition. While not currently regulated by US federal drug laws, several states have passed laws criminalizing the substance. Some proposed state bills have failed to progress and have not been made into law (with motions having been voted down or otherwise dying in committee stages). There have not been many publicized prosecutions of individuals violating anti-salvia laws in the few countries and states in which it has been made illegal. \n\n Effects: \n\n After the peak effects, normal awareness-of-self and the immediate surroundings return but lingering effects may be felt. These short-term lingering effects have a completely different character than the peak experience. About half of users report a pleasing \'afterglow\', or pleasant state of mind following the main effects. Researchers from the University of California and California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute conducted a survey of 500 salvia users which identified that they \'sometimes or often\' experience certain effects, including: \n\n - Increased insight \n\n - Improved mood \n\n - Increased connection with Universe or Nature \n\n - Increased sweating \n\n - ody felt warm or hot \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Differing studies suggest no consensus so far with regard to the long-term effects of Salvia divinorum on mood. It is well-established that some k-opioid agonists can cause dysphoria in humans. One study using rats in forced-swim tests has been used to suggest that Salvia divinorum may have depressive-like effects, although this conclusion has been contradiucted by subsequent research. \n\n However, a report has been published detailing an individual case of Salvia divinorum use as self-medicated treatment for depression, and Baggott\'s survey of 500 people with firsthand experience of salvia found that 25.8% of respondents reported improved mood and antidepressant-like effects lasting 24 hours or longer. Only 4.4% reported persisting (24 hours or more) negative effects (most often anxiety) on at least one occasion. There has been one report of salvia precipitating psychosis. However, the authors suspected that their patient was already genetically predisposed to schizophrenia. \n\n It has been suggested that the long-term effects of salvia use may include feelings of Deja vu. The Baggott survey found little evidence of addictive potential (chemical dependence) in its survey population. 0.6% percent of respondents reported feeling addicted to or dependent on salvia at some point, and 1.2% reported strong cravings. About this the researchers said there were too few of these individuals to interpret their reports with any confidence Most users report no hangover or negative after-effects (e.g. withdrawal, comedown or rebound effect) the next day. This is consistent with the apparent low toxicity of salvia indicated by research conducted at the University of Nebraska. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Fatal poisoning from Salvia divinorum appears to be very unlikely to occur. No case of fatal salvinorin poisoning has been reported. The human oral lethal dose is not known but is believed to be extremely high. Swallowed salvinorin is not well absorbed. The chances of inadvertently swallowing a lethal overdose of an oral preparation of leaves, tinctures/elixirs, or soft/hard extracts are extremely low. \n\n If salvinorin is inhaled as multiple inhalations of leaf smoke or vapor one could reasonably expect to pass out before he/she could take a lethal overdose. But significantly, nothing is known about the toxic effects of smoking truly massive single bolus doses of pure salvinorin, such a practice might be quite dangerous, and should certainly be avoided. \n\n Acutely, salvinorin-A induces what could be termed a toxic psychosis, in other words one may see visions, hear voices, have bizarre thought patterns etc. This is normal when tripping. The acute effects of Salvia (both desirable and undesirable) wear off very quickly. However for some people the overwhelming strangeness of the Salvia experience (or perhaps some direct effect of salvinorin in the brain) can trigger panic attacks. \n\n Signs of Abuse: \n\n Salvia is not addicting and therefore there are few signs to tell if someone is abusing salvia repeatedly. The best way to find out would be to catch the person in the act of tripping, in which it would be very obvious the person was high on salvia. Salvia in most cases is non habit forming and does not pose addiction risk like some other drugs do. \n\n Physical Signs: \n\n - dilated pupils \n\n - fast heartbeat \n\n - intense hallucinations \n\n - paranoia \n\n - anxiety \n\n - dry mouth \n\n - laughter \n\n - feeling of being weighed down \n\n Treatment: \n\n There are currently no treatments for salvia as it is not considered habit forming.

There are two types of AAS: \n\n Exogenous: Synthetic versions of testosterone. Common examples include Nandrolone and Danazol. \n\n Endogenous: Naturally occurring substances involved in the metabolic pathways of testosterone. When testing for drug use, all endogenous steroids have a normal range. Results outside of this normal range are deemed positive. \n\n Steroids can be taken either orally or by intra-muscular injection and are used in a cyclical pattern with 6-12 weeks of heavy use followed by periods of between 1 and 12 months, drug-free. During the heavy use period a pyramid system is usually followed where a gradual increase in daily dose reaches a peak and is then reversed. \n\n Lately other methods of delivery have been used, including tablets, nasal sprays, skin patches, and creams. Due to the enhancement of testing procedures in the detection of anabolic steroids, \'designer steroids\' such as THG have been developed. THG breaks down during the preparation method used for normal steroid testing procedures. A test specifically for the detection of THG has since been developed. \n\n Medical Uses: \n\n Anabolic Steroids have been used previously as a hormone replacement to treat: \n\n - Hypogonadism (defect of function of the testes or ovaries)\n\n - KlinefelterÕs syndrome (Sometimes known as XXY syndrome, where a male has an additional X chromosome. This results in reduced fertility) \n\n - Delayed puberty \n\n - Some forms of anemia (AASÕs have a stimulatory effect on bone marrow which may increase red blood cell production) \n\n - COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) \n\n - HIV \n\n - Muscular dystrophy \n\n - Severe cases of osteoporosis \n\n Side Effects:  \n\n  Side-effects from the use of steroids are extremely common and can be quite significant. Most side-effects are reversible once the athlete stops usage although serious long-term side-effects and even death have occurred as a direct result of steroid use. \n\n - Decreased sperm production and sex drive \n\n - Increased aggression, irritability and mood swings \n\n -  Liver disorders \n\n - Acne \n\n - Baldness (alopecia) \n\n - Hypertension (high blood pressure) \n\n - Raised cholesterol \n\n - Gynecomastia (male breasts) \n\n - Menstrual irregularities (in women) \n\n - Deepening of the voice  \n\n - Reduced immunity \n\n Performance Effects: \n\n Steroids are most commonly used by athletes involved in power sports, for example weight lifting, throwing and sprinting events. Field sports such as American Football and Rugby also demonstrate a high incidence of use, as does body building. The perceived benefits of AAS use include: \n\n - Increased muscle bulk \n\n - Increased muscle strength \n\n - increase in speed/agility \n\n - Faster muscle recovery \n\n - Reduced muscle catabolism (breakdown of muscle) \n\n - harder erections \n\n Treatment: \n\n Believe it or not people do become addicted to using steroids. However, it is not like most drug addictions where the user must use the drug. AAS addiction is more because the user wants to keep all the gains they have made with previous cycles. \n\n Counseling is the mainstay of therapy for anabolic steroid abuse. The patient and their support group, family and friends, need to appreciate that the approach to this addiction may be similar to addiction to other drugs and alcohol. Depression and suicidal thoughts may occur when the steroids are stopped, and this potential must be monitored closely. \n\n ");

It is most commonly available as the hydrochloride salt, clenbuterol hydrochloride. \n\n Clenbuterol is a B2 agonist with some structural and pharmacological similarities to epinephrine and salbutamol, but its effects are more potent and longer-lasting as a stimulant and thermogenic drug. It causes an increase in aerobic capacity, central nervous system stimulation, blood pressure, and oxygen transportation.

Users sometimes ingest PCP by snorting the powder or by swallowing it in tablet form. Normally a white crystalline powder, PCP is sometimes colored with water-soluble or alcohol-soluble dyes. \n\n When snorted or smoked, PCP rapidly passes to the brain to disrupt the functioning of sites known as NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor complexes, which are receptors for the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate receptors play a major role in the perception of pain, in cognition - including learning and memory - and in emotion. \n\n In the brain, PCP also alters the actions of dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for the euphoria and rush associated with many abused drugs.\n\n Effects: \n\n A person who is high on PCP may breathe shallowly, sweat excessively, be flushed and have numb extremities. He (or she) may move with poor coordination, be nauseated and vomit. His eyes may flicker up and down or he may stare fixedly at nothing. These physical effects are in addition to the delusions and other mental effects. \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n If a person abuses this drug over a long period of time, the effects can be disabling. A person who abuses this drug long-term is very likely to have memory loss, difficulty speaking and thinking clearly. They are likely to be very depressed. \n\n The abuser may lose the ability to complete tasks or communicate with others. He can become withdrawn and isolate himself completely. A person on PCP can manifest a completely psychotic state and long-term use makes this drug-induced psychosis more lasting. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n  - Sedation \n\n - immobility \n\n - amnesia \n\n - Slurred speech and other speech difficulties \n\n - numbness \n\n - A sense of invulnerability \n\n - Rapid, involuntary eye movements \n\n - Hallucinations \n\n - High blood pressure \n\n - Rapid Heartbeat \n\n Long Term Effects:  \n\n -  Inability to think clearly \n\n - Inability to speak \n\n - Suicidal thoughts \n\n - Brain Damage \n\n - Depression \n\n - Isolation and withdrawal \n\n - Anxiety \n\n Overdose: \n\n PCP (Phencyclidine) overdose is widely reported in the media, and the ability of the drug to cause a user to act irrationally or violently is one of the drugÕs most famous qualities. A PCP overdose can cause a drug user to put himself or other people in danger, as the drug removes the reasoning skills that a person would use to avoid potentially dangerous situations. PCP users may commit suicide or harm their loved ones. \n\n Large amounts of PCP can have a serious effect on the body of the user. In addition to the risk of death through impaired reasoning, PCP users may risk: \n\n - Heart attacks \n\n - Seizure \n\n - An impaired ability to breathe (known as respiratory depression) \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n PCP creates a dissociative state in the user in which the aforementioned loss of reasoning can occur. Other symptoms of PCP use may vary depending on the user. Many PCP users will keep looking around a room and will seem unwilling or unable to focus on a single spot. Speech may become slurred. PCP users may feel a loss of muscle control or nausea. Many PCP users will begin vomiting after taking large doses of the drug. \n\n Serious psychological symptoms can occur in a person who has been taking PCP. At high doses, a PCP user may begin to feel extremely depressed or aggressive. In some cases, PCP users will seek medical attention voluntarily due to extreme feelings of depression, which can be unpleasant and even dangerous. \n\n Treatment: \n\n PCP is addictive, causing craving, compulsive seeking for the drug, and increased tolerance and dependency. As dosages go up, so do risks, with schizophrenic behavior more and more likely. Coma, circulatory damage, memory loss, and learning impairment are common secondary effects. \n\n Whether you or someone you know is in need of help and support getting through the process of drug rehabilitation, itÕs most easily done using good resources to guide you to solid programs and professionals.

Though it is often referred to as Amyl Nitrate, the Nitrate is a diesel fuel additive, and though similarly named, the two are distinct and should not be confused. \n\n Amyl Nitrite was first synthesised in a laboratory in 1844 by French chemist Antoine Balard. It has been used as a medical treatment around the world since as far back as the 1860s, most commonly for the treatment of heart conditions such as angina. However as more effective treatments have since become available for these purposes, it is not commonly prescribed as a heart medication today. The drug has also been found to be effective in treating cyanide poisoning. \n\n Amyl Nitrite is a vasodilator, meaning that it dilates the blood vessels of the individual, allowing more blood to pass through and so lowering blood pressure. \n\n Since the 1970s, Amyl Nitrite has also been used as a recreational drug, most commonly referred to as ÔpoppersÕ. This name comes from early forms of Amyl Nitrite medication which came in the form of crushable (or ÔpoppedÕ) ampoules to be inhaled by angina sufferers. However in modern recreational use it usually comes in the form of a liquid contained in a small glass bottle. \n\n Effects: \n\n When an individual inhales Amyl Nitrite they feel an intense but short-lasting ÔrushÕ. The symptoms of this include: \n\n - euphoria \n\n - warm tingling sensation \n\n -  excitement \n\n - muscle relaxation \n\n - light-headedness \n\n  Long Term Effects: \n\n There are no reported long term effects of Amyl Nitrite. \n\n  Overdose - Possible negative side effects and overdose symptoms associated with acute intake of Amyl Nitrite include: \n\n - Emesis (vomiting) \n\n - Hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure) \n\n - Hypoventilation (respiratory depression) \n\n - Dyspnea (shortness of breath) \n\n - Syncope (fainting) \n\n - Asphyxia (suffocation) \n\n - Arrhythmia (irregular heart beat) \n\n - Cardiovascular depression \n\n - Hepatorenal toxicity \n\n - Hemolysis \n\n Usage: \n\n The drug is still widely used among gay men. One study examined the use of poppers among gay men who experienced childhood sexual abuse. While such drugs as crystal meth, ecstasy and ketamine decreased during the 2000s, use of poppers and cocaine remained stable among gay men. Poppers continue to be used, along with other drugs, in party-and-play sex marathons, in which participants have sex for hours at a time. \n\n The use of poppers as a psychoactive drug spread from the gay scene to the recreational drug community, becoming more widespread with the disco boom of the 1970s and the club and rave scenes of the 1980s and 90s. It has been recognized as a serious health problem among Canadian Aboriginal communities but crosses social classes. \n\n In Britain, 14.9% of university students, 12.8% of male medical students and 6.3% of female medical students have used poppers recreationally. In addition, there has been concern about the recent increase in inhalant use, including poppers, among teens. \n\n  ");

People who use it often donÕt eat or sleep properly. They can experience greatly increased heart rate, muscle spasms and convulsions. The drug can make people feel paranoid, angry, hostile and anxiousÑeven when they arenÕt high. \n\n Regardless of how much of the drug is used or how frequently, crack cocaine increases the risk that the user will experience a heart attack, stroke, seizure or respiratory (breathing) failure, any of which can result in sudden death. \n\n Smoking crack further presents a series of health risks. Crack is often mixed with other substances that create toxic fumes when burned. As crack smoke does not remain potent for long, crack pipes are generally very short. This often causes cracked and blistered lips, known as Òcrack lip,Ó from users having a very hot pipe pressed against their lips. \n\n Effects: \n\n When an addict smokes crack he or she inhales large quantities of the drug\'s smoke into their lungs, which in turn produces a very temporary state of euphoria. With continued use, the crack loses its effects and the user has to have more of it to achieve the same results. Many times the user will smoke crack and chase it with alcohol to extend or intensify the drugs effect. Many addicts will use a sharp instrument to clean the resins from the pipe and re-smoke it once the rock is gone. \n\n Some who has just used crack may show these effects: \n\n - Sweating \n\n - Paranoia \n\n - Intense Euphoria \n\n -  Restless breathing \n\n - Restless sleep with unusual snoring and or breathing patterns \n\n - Irregular heartbeat \n\n - Personality changes \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n In addition to the usual risks associated with cocaine use, crack addicts may experience severe respiratory problems, including coughing, shortness of breath, lung damage and bleeding. \n\n Long-term effects from use of crack cocaine include severe damage to the heart, liver and kidneys. Addicts are far more likely to have infectious diseases. Continued daily use causes sleep deprivation and loss of appetite, resulting in malnutrition. Smoking crack cocaine also can cause aggressive and paranoid behavior. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Crack cocaine overdose occurs when a lot of the drug is needed to induce a high. This is the case for long-time users. Many addicts mix cocaine with another drug in a practice that increases the likelihood of an overdose as well. The signs of an overdose on crack cocaine that you should look for include a combination of: \n\n - Vomiting \n\n - Coughing that produces black mucus \n\n - Violent behavior \n\n - Hallucinations \n\n - Slowed Breathing \n\n - Slowing heart rate \n\n Any combination of these symptoms can signify a crack cocaine overdose. If you suspect an overdose, immediately take the addict to the emergency room for care. Doing so improves the chances of surviving the overdose tremendously. This is especially true if the crack cocaine overdose symptoms are caught early on. The advanced symptoms include: \n\n - Stopped breathing \n\n - Seizures \n\n - Stopped pulse \n\n - Coma \n\n - Vomiting \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n - Drop in attendance and performance at work or school \n\n - Unexplained need for money or financial problems. May borrow or steal to get it  \n\n - Engaging in secretive or suspicious behaviors \n\n - Sudden change in friends, favorite hangouts, and hobbies \n\n - Frequently getting into trouble (fights, accidents, illegal activities) \n\n  Physical Signs: \n\n - Bloodshot eyes, pupils larger or smaller than usual \n\n - Changes in appetite or sleep patterns. Sudden weight loss or weight gain \n\n - Deterioration of physical appearance, personal grooming habits \n\n  - Unusual smells on breath, body, or clothing \n\n - Tremors, slurred speech, or impaired coordination \n\n Treatment: \n\n An unfortunate fact about the treatment of cocaine and other drug addiction is that it continues to be unutilized by most addicted individuals. For example, less than 10% of people with a substance abuse disorder and less than 40% of those with a substance dependence disorder receive treatment. Those statistics seem to be independent of socioeconomic or other demographic characteristics but do seem to be associated with the presence of other mental health problems (comorbidity). \n\n The primary goals for the treatment of addiction symptoms (also called recovery) are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation. When the addicted person first abstains from using drugs, he or she may need help avoiding or lessening the effects of withdrawal. \n\n That process is called detoxification or detox. That part of treatment is usually performed in a hospital or other inpatient setting (often called detox centers), where medications used to decrease withdrawal symptoms and frequent medical assessments can be provided. The medications used as part of detox depend on the substance the individual is dependent upon \n\n As with many other drugs of abuse, the detox process from cocaine is the most difficult aspect of coping with the physical symptoms of addiction and tends to last days. Medications that are sometimes used to help cocaine addicts abstain from drugs use include propranolol (Inderal, Inderal LA, InnoPran XL), which decreases some of the physical symptoms associated with cocaine withdrawal, as well as vigabatrin (Sabril), a medication that treats seizures. \n\n");

It is just one form of the drug methamphetamine. \n\n Methamphetamine is a white crystalline drug that people take by snorting it (inhaling through the nose), smoking it or injecting it with a needle. Some even take it orally, but all develop a strong desire to continue using it because the drug creates a false sense of happiness and well-beingÑa rush (strong feeling) of confidence, hyperactiveness and energy. One also experiences decreased appetite. These drug effects generally last from six to eight hours, but can last up to twenty-four hours. \n\n The first experience might involve some pleasure, but from the start, methamphetamine begins to destroy the userÕs life. \n\n Crystal meth is used by individuals of all ages, but is most commonly used as a Òclub drug,Ó taken while partying in night clubs or at rave parties. Its most common street names are ice or glass. \n\n Effects: \n\n The short-term effects of crystal meth when taken in large doses is erratic and even violent behavior. Other short-term effects of crystal meth include: \n\n - Loss of appetite \n\n - Euphoria \n\n - Change in sleeping patterns \n\n - Severe mood swings \n\n - Unpredictable behavior \n\n - Tremors or convulsions \n\n - Elevated blood pressure \n\n - Irregular heart rate  \n\n - Dilated pupils \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n Taken over a long period of time, crystal meth can cause severe physical and psychological issues.  Signs of long-term abuse include: \n\n - A feeling of bugs crawling on the skin \n\n - Body sores from users picking at their skin \n\n - Psychosis and hallucinations \n\n - Brain damage \n\n - Stroke \n\n - Coma \n\n Severe crystal meth abuse can also cause outward signs of aging in users. The drug destroys tissues and blood vessels and hampers the bodyÕs ability to heal. Users often develop acne, and the skin takes on a dull look and loses its elasticity. The teeth begin to decay and crack, resulting in a condition known as meth mouth. \n\n Overdose: \n\n An overdose occurs when you take more of the drug than your body can handle. Crystal meth can be smoked, injected, snorted or swallowed.  \n\n An overdose can result from any of these methods of ingestion. An overdose may be intentional or unintentional, and it may occur in users taking the drug for rare legitimate purposes or in those misusing the drug. Overdose is most common in users who are injecting the drug, and first-time meth users who have no tolerance and are injecting the drug are particularly at risk. \n\n Crystal meth is very rarely found in its pure form, so an overdose may also result from a reaction to the chemicals added to the drug. Because of this, overdose is possible even from a non-lethal dose, as users may be unable to accurately judge the amount of crystal meth they are consuming. There is no way to calculate a safe level of the drug, and crystal meth may prove lethal at relatively small doses to a new user.  \n\n Crystal meth has a high potential for addiction and abuse, and users may quickly build up tolerance to the drug, increasing their chances of an overdose as they increase the amount of the drug they take. If you know someone using this drug, it is a good idea to be familiar with the signs of an overdose on crystal meth, so you can get them help immediately -- before it\'s too late. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n Crystal meth has surpassed cocaine as the drug of choice for young people and has left a wake of destroyed lives in its aftermath. Meth addiction runs rampant in America and throughout the world. As such, parents and users need to recognize the signs of methamphetamine addiction and seek out treatment. \n\n Crystal meth signs and symptoms are often related to the drugÕs impact on the body as a function of its stimulant nature. A single sign may not determine an addiction, but several signs seen over a short period of time can mean an addiction. Signs include: \n\n - Dilated pupils \n\n - Weight loss \n\n - Eye Twitching \n\n - Loss of appetite \n\n - Repetitious behavior \n\n - Hyperactivity \n\n People with an addiction to methamphetamine can also stay up for days at a time followed by an extreme crash, where they sleep for long periods. They can also go into a manic phase, where they have compulsive and obsessive needs for cleaning. \n\n Treatment: \n\n The common first step in treating crystal meth abuse is detoxification. This requires the addicted person to stop taking the drug and go into withdrawal. The symptoms of withdrawal can be intense, so a rehab center or family members are needed for support. Once the withdrawal occurs, the addict is likely to take the drug again, unless there is a strong support system. \n\n ince methamphetamine is a stimulant, treatment continues with addressing and treating depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. This treatment uses both medication and psychology. Often, there are underlying psychological reasons why a person uses drugs. Without addressing these reasons, the person is more likely to return to the drug.  \n\n Crystal Meth Statistics: \n\n - The severe tooth decay caused by crystal meth addiction is called meth mouth \n\n - In Asia, meth is commonly used as a pill called Yaba in Thailand and Shabu in the Philippines \n\n - In Hawaii, 48.2 percent of those seeking addiction help for drug abuse were crystal meth users \n\n - The worldwide production of amphetamine stimulants is more than 500 metric tons per year, according the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \n\n - There are more than 24.7 million methamphetamine users in the world \n\n - Crystal meth has one of the highest relapse rates of any drug \n\n ");

People who use oxycodone in a recreational, hazardous, or harmful fashion (not as intended by the prescribing physician) are at even higher risk of severe withdrawal symptoms, as they tend to use higher-than-prescribed doses \n\n Oxycodone has both positive and negative short-term side effects. Positive effects include: \n\n - Slightly euphoric state of mind. Even if you are taking the drug as prescribed, itÕs possible to get high on Oxycodone. This drug lifts your mood slightly and lessens anxiety, which can make it attractive to people who suffer from depression or anxiety. \n\n - locking of pain messages to the brain. Oxycodone works by blocking pain messages from the nerves to the brain. As a result, the drug temporarily stops you from feeling physical pain \n\n - Drowsiness. Oxycodone slows down the respiratory system and central nervous system, which makes users feel drowsy. Some users find it easier to sleep after taking Oxycodone. \n\n These positive effects are counterbalanced by some negative side effects. Negative side effects include things like nausea and constipation. In some cases, people may have trouble breathing if they take a large dose of Oxycodone, because the drug slows down the respiratory system. \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n The positive side effects of Oxycodone have caused many people to become addicted to it over the last 20 years. Oxycodone is only meant to be used for a few weeks at a time; using it for longer periods of time can cause serious health problems such as: \n\n High levels of drug tolerance. Oxycodone is physically addicting, which means that your body needs higher amounts of the drug over time in order to experience the same effects. Thus, if you use Oxycodone for a long period of time, youÕll need higher doses of it, which puts you at greater risk for respiratory failure. \n\n Respiratory distress. Since Oxycodone works by slowing down the respiratory and central nervous systems, you may experience respiratory distress if you take it for a long period of time or take higher doses of the drug. Symptoms of respiratory distress include difficulty breathing, lightheadedness and dizziness from lack of oxygen. \n\n Physical dependence. After taking Oxycodone for a long period of time, users develop a physical need for the drug in order to function appropriately. Long-term Oxycodone users may feel physically ill if they donÕt take the drug. \n\n Overdose: \n\n In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. \n\n The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on OxyContin. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. \n\n In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n Other than a drug test, one can use the following symptoms to detect oxycodone or OxyContin abuse:  \n\n - Drowsiness, sometimes to the point of nodding off \n\n - Sedation \n\n - Euphoria \n\n -Lightheadedness  \n\n - itching \n\n -Respiratory suppression  \n\n - Dry mouth \n\n - Nausea and vomiting \n\n In many cases, the person who is addicted didn\'t start out abusing the drug but took it exactly according to the doctor\'s instruction. But opiates result in a person building up a tolerance. That means that after a 20 milligram dose is taken for while, it no longer handles the person\'s pain and they must increase the dose to 40 milligrams, and so on. A person who has been using opiates for a long time can take a dose that would kill a person who was new to the drug. This person can end up with a problem when the dosage the doctor prescribes is not enough. He may begin seeking more drugs through illegal means like doctor-shopping. \n\n Treatment: \n\n When a person is addicted to an opiate like oxycodone, it is possible to get clean at last, and stay that way. Some people have been through so many rehab programs that they may have given up on trying to find lasting sobriety. But at Narconon drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs around the world, it is still possible to find sobriety. \n\n The Narconon program is long-term, giving people time to find real recovery. The physical and mental damage done by addiction to oxycodone must be repaired and the person must learn the life skills that will keep him safe for the rest of his life. By learning these skills, each person also learns how to overcome the problems that may have driven him to abuse drugs in the first place. \n\n It\'s an effective program with a common-sense foundation. No drugs are ever used as part of treatment. So addiction ends the day the person walks in the door of a Narconon drug recovery center. Find out more today by calling 1-800-775-8750. \n\n");

It is a cough suppressant and, when used properly following a doctorÕs instructions or the recommended dosage, it can be safe and effective. When abused, dextromethorphan takes on qualities of a dissociative drug. This means that it produces feelings of detachment in a person, as well as distorting a person\'s perception of sight and sound. Abuse of dextromethorphan occurs when someone is ingesting an amount that exceeds the recommended dosage. \n\n Dextromethorphan is a synthetic drug, and is made in the labs of pharmaceutical companies. It is legally available in many different drug stores. It first appeared in the 1960s as a replacement for codeine in cough syrups due to codeineÕs addictive qualities. It is used today as a cough suppressant in many over-the-counter cold medicines. \n\n Effects: \n\n - Euphoria \n\n - Sense of heightened perceptual awareness \n\n - Altered time perception \n\n - Visual hallucinations \n\n  The short-term effects of dextromethorphan include, but are not limited to, blurred vision, numbness, muscle spasms, heart attack, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, slurred speech, psychosis, hallucinations, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, poor co-ordination, over heating, itchy skin and rash. \n\n Long Term Effects: \n\n The long-term side-effects of dextromethorphan abuse are not yet fully known, but it is believed that dextromethorphan abuse may cause things such as depression, liver problems, psychosis and learning and memory problems. As well, abusing dextromethorphan can lead to coma or death. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n  Signs that a person may be using dextromethorphan include, but are not limited to, mood swings, a change in behaviour, trouble speaking, trouble walking straight, the appearance of being drunk, a decrease in school or work performance, finding over-the-counter drugs in the person\'s room or backpack, over-the-counter drugs disappearing from the cabinet, and taking cold medications when not ill. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Combining dextromethorphan with other substances can compound risks. CNS stimulants such as amphetamine and/or cocaine can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure and heart rate. CNS depressants such as ethanol (drinking alcohol) will have a combined depressant effect, which can cause a decreased respiratory rate. Combining dextromethorphan with other CYP2D6 substrates can cause both drugs to build to dangerous levels in the bloodstream. \n\n Combining dextromethorphan with other serotonergic drugs could possibly cause serotonin toxicity, an excess of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). \n\n");

This means that it grows from a spore, usually in the dirt or on decaying plant material, such as a log. While some varieties contain vitamins and nutrients, mushrooms are mainly used to give an earthy flavor and meaty texture to everything from pizza to risotto. \n\n Some mushrooms, however, are famous for more than their taste. Known as magic mushrooms, shrooms, mushies, psychedelic mushrooms, psychotropic mushrooms or psilocybin, these mushrooms cause differences in mood, perception and behavior that are commonly known as tripping. \n\n These types of mushrooms belong to the genus Psilocybe. Mushrooms of other genera can also cause hallucinations, but many purists insist that Psilocybe mushrooms are the true magic mushrooms. Psilocybe mushrooms cause hallucinations because they contain the psychotropic tryptamines psilocybin and psilocin (some species also contain other, weaker psychotropic compounds like baeocystin or norbaeocystin). A single mushroom contains anywhere from 0.2 to 0.4 percent psilocybin. \n\n Magic mushrooms are one of the most widely used recreational psychotropic drugs because they can be found in the wild or grown fairly easily and inexpensively. According to the 2003 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about 8 percent of adults over the age of 26 in the United States have used magic mushrooms [source: Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration]. \n\n Unlike manufactured psychotropic drugs such as LSD, magic mushrooms have a long history dating back thousands of years as part of religious or spiritual ceremonies. However, magic mushrooms also have a lot in common with LSD. \n\n Effects: \n\n Mushrooms have a lot in common with LSD in terms of how they affect the body. Both are psychotropic drugs and act on the central nervous system to produce their effects. Many people have described a mushroom trip as a milder, shorter version of an LSD trip. Like LSD, magic mushrooms don\'t technically cause hallucinations, or visions of things that aren\'t actually there. Instead, they distort the perception of actual objects. \n\n People tripping on mushrooms might see things in different colors or see patterns. Existing colors, sounds, tastes and textures may be distorted, while feelings and emotions intensify. It can feel like time has sped up, slowed down or stopped completely. There can be a changed perception of one\'s place in the universe and a feeling of communing with a higher power. \n\n Overdose: \n\n Magic mushroom users report a wide range of symptoms, but one of the most common negative symptoms is colloquially referred to as a Òbad trip.Ó During a bad trip, mushroom users will feel extremely anxious or paranoid. They may become violent or withdrawn. These feelings wear off with the rest of the mushroomsÕ effects. \n\n Taking a large number of magic mushrooms will often result in extremely intense visual distortions that can be very unpleasant. This is often accompanies by waves of nausea. Some users may vomit after a mushrooms overdose. \n\n After a mushrooms overdose, a drug user may report symptoms similar to the hangover that follows excessive alcohol use. This mushroom ÒhangoverÓ can be extremely severe and can lead to intense nausea, headaches, and other nonfatal but unpleasant symptoms. \n\n Warning Signs of Abuse: \n\n Mushrooms aren\'t considered to be addictive, but tolerance builds up very quickly -- taking mushrooms two days in a row often results in a less intense experience the second day, for example. There may be cross-tolerance with some other psychotropic drugs like LSD, mescaline and peyote, which means that taking one can build up tolerance for another. \n\n So, are they dangerous? People with mental illnesses (diagnosed or not) have had their symptoms exacerbated through the use of mushrooms. There\'s no evidence of death caused by magic mushrooms; the amount that one would have to eat to cause death is hundreds of times greater than the normal dose. Death can result from taking misidentified mushrooms, however. \n\n");
      var6.putString("25", "Street Names: \n\n Khat, Qat, Kat, Chat, Miraa, Quaadka \n\n Khat or Qat (Catha edulis; edible kat is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Among communities from these areas, khat chewing has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years. \n\n Khat contains a monoamine alkaloid called cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant, which is said to cause excitement, loss of appetite and euphoria. In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a drug of abuse that can produce mild to moderate psychological dependence (less than tobacco or alcohol), although WHO does not consider khat to be seriously addictive. The plant has been targeted by anti-drug organizations such as the DEA.[4] It is a controlled substance in some countries, such as the United States, Canada and Germany, while its production, sale, and consumption are legal in other nations, including Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen. \n\n Effects: \n\n Khat consumption induces mild euphoria and excitement, similar to that conferred by strong coffee.[2] Individuals become very talkative under the influence of the plant. The effects of oral administration of cathinone occur more rapidly than the effects of amphetamine pills, roughly 15 minutes as compared to 30 minutes in amphetamine. Khat can induce manic behaviors and hyperactivity similar in effects to those produced by amphetamine. \n\n The use of khat results in constipation. Dilated pupils (mydriasis) are prominent during khat consumption, reflecting the sympathomimetic effects of the drug, which are also reflected in increased heart rate and blood pressure. \n\n Withdrawal symptoms that may follow occasional use include mild depression and irritability. Withdrawal symptoms that may follow prolonged khat use include lethargy, mild depression, nightmares, and slight tremor. Khat is an effective anorectic (causes loss of appetite). Long-term use can precipitate the following effects: negative impact on liver function, permanent tooth darkening (of a greenish tinge), susceptibility to ulcers, and diminished sex drive. \n\n Health Effects: \n\n Immediate effects: \n\n - increased heart rate, blood pressure \n\n - euphoria \n\n - hyperactivity \n\n - decreased appetite \n\n - Long-term effects: \n\n - depression \n\n - infrequent hallucinations \n\n - delayed response inhibition \n\n - increased risk of myocardial infarction \n\n - psychosis in extreme cases in the genetically predisposed[ \n\n - oral cancer \n\n Abuse: \n\n There is no specific physical addiction to khat; however, there is a psychological dependence. Regular users of khat can develop a psychological dependency to the drug. Signs of withdrawal include minor laziness, mild depression, nightmares, and slight tremor. \n\n There is no specific physical addiction to khat; however, there is a psychological dependence. Regular users of khat can develop a psychological dependency to the drug. Signs of withdrawal include minor laziness, mild depression, nightmares, and slight tremor. \n\n History: \n\n Although khat is legal in certain parts of Europe, East Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula, it is illegal in the United States. A recreational and religious drug used commonly by natives of the source countries, khat can be found in many social environments. During the celebration of Ramadan, khat use is very popular to relieve fatigue and reduce appetite. In certain social environments, khat is used in place of alcohol. According to Arab journals from the 13th century, physicians have used khat to treat depression and lack of energy. Peasants in certain cultures who worked long hours also used this stimulant. \n\n In countries where khat grows abundantly, the drug is found to be a large part of that countryÕs economy. In Ethiopia, for example, khat is the 4th largest export. After being cut from a 10 to 20 ft. tall flowering evergreen shrub, khat leaves are bundled in plastic bags or banana leaves so the moisture and freshness of the active ingredients in the plant are retained as it is smuggled into the United States and any other countries. \n\n");
